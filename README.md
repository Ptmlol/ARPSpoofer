# ARPSpoofer
Powerful Linux Python Terminal program used to ARP spoof a target and it s interface MITM(Man in The Middle) attacks.
Only with Linux at the moment..
Windows coming soon..
Python2 + compatible.

Use: 
>python arpspoofer.py --help    

in the Linux terminal to display syntax and other useful informations.

It sends packets to the target ip and the router fooling them both of them.
It will return the count of packets sent every 2 seconds.
Works well with other hacking programs on my list.
It resets ip tables after CTRL+C detected to erase traces from the victim's computer.
