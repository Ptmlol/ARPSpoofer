# ARPSpoofer
Powerful Linux Python3 Terminal program used to ARP spoof a target and it s interface MITM(Man in The Middle) attacks.
Only with Linux/Python3 at the moment. Windows/Python<3 coming soon..

Powerful Linux programm used to become MITM.
Use >python3 arpspoofer.py --help    in the Linux terminal to display syntax and other useful informations.
It sends packets to the target ip and the router fooling them both of them. It will return the count of packets sent every 2 seconds.
Works well with other hacking programs on my list.
It resets ip tables after CTRL+C detected to erase traces from the victim's computer.
